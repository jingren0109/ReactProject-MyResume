Designed and developed a user interface that allows users to input loan data and receive predictions with clear visualization of results. Implemented secure API endpoints, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity throughout the loan prediction process.

Developed a sophisticated combined model, incorporating neural networks, XGBoost, and SVM, to accurately predict loan approval or denial.
